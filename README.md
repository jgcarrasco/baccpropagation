# baccpropagation
Implementing neural networks in C. The idea of this project is to (i) learn C and (ii) get a solid understanding of the
fundamental concepts of backpropagation. I expect the code to be extremely cursed, but I think that it is a fun idea!
The codebase is strongly inspired on [Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) (thanks
Andrej!)

# TO-DO
